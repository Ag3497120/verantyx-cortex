## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-19

### 🆕 Triple-Track Autonomous GC

The memory system now manages itself through three independent, parallel mechanisms, replacing the single LRU-only approach.

#### Track A-1: Content Classifier (`classifyNode`)
- **New** `classifyNode(content, fileName): ZoneClassification` in `engine.ts`
- Runs **before every write** — determines correct zone from content fingerprints
- Priority rules: external/bench data → `deep/`, user profile → `front/`, code knowledge → `near/`
- Confidence threshold: 0.8 minimum to trigger reclassification
- Zero LLM cost, deterministic, < 1ms execution

#### Track A-2: Reference Count Ledger
- **New** `RefCountLedger` class in `engine.ts`
- Stored at `~/.openclaw/memory/meta/ref_counts.json`
- Every `read()` call increments reference count
- Cold nodes auto-demote: `front/` (3 days + < 2 reads), `near/` (7 days + < 1 read)
- Operates independently of LRU cap evictions

#### Track B: LRU Cascade with Tombstone
- Updated `runAutonomousGc()` (replaces `runLruGc()`)
- **New** `writeTombstone()`: writes `JCROSS_TOMB_<filename>` in source zone before eviction
- Tombstone preserves L1 Kanji topology for instant retrieval even after eviction
- Cap configuration: `front/` 100, `near/` 1,000, `mid/` 5,000, `deep/` unlimited

#### Track C: Contextual Intelligence Index
- **New file** `src/memory/intelligence.ts`
- `DecisionLedger`: append-only JSONL log at `meta/decisions.jsonl`
- `PatternExtractor`: derives confidence-scored rules from accumulated decisions
- `updateProjectWisdom()`: rewrites `front/PROJECT_WISDOM.jcross` every 50 decisions
- `PROJECT_WISDOM.jcross` enables any new LLM session to make project-expert zone decisions

### 🆕 Pre-Write Zone Classification in `compile_trilayer_memory`

Previously: always wrote to `front/` regardless of content.  
Now: `classifyNode()` runs first → node written directly to the correct zone.

```
Bench/external data → deep/   (never pollutes front/ or near/)
User profile anchor → front/
Technical knowledge → near/
Default             → near/
```

### 🆕 Session Management MCP Tools (5 new tools)

#### `session_bootstrap`
- Loads `PROJECT_WISDOM.jcross` + user profile + `front/` L1 nodes
- Returns structured JSON: `{ project_wisdom, user_profile, front_nodes, zone_counts }`
- Pre-reads `REIMMERSION_PROTOCOL.jcross` if present
- **Use this as the first call on every new session**

#### `recall_fact(key)`
- Instant lookup of a specific profile fact
- Pattern-matches `OP.ENTITY/FACT/STATE("key", "value")` in `user_profile.jcross`
- < 5ms for any key

#### `store_fact(key, value)`
- Persists a fact to `front/user_profile.jcross` immediately
- Updates existing `OP.*` line or appends new one
- Thread-safe via MVCC locking

#### `run_lru_gc`
- Full triple-track GC on demand
- Returns detailed report: `{ classifier, coldEvictions, lruEvictions }`
- Also triggers `PROJECT_WISDOM` update if enough decisions accumulated

#### `generate_reimmersion_guide`
- Cognitive cold-start eliminator
- Generates 7–9 step protocol with fictional review tasks pointing to real architecture files
- Saves `REIMMERSION_PROTOCOL.jcross` to `front/`
- Auto-detects `~/verantyx-cli` project root

### 🆕 Cold-Start Elimination System

**New file** `src/memory/reimmersion.ts`:
- `getProjectAnatomyFiles()`: lists key architecture files ordered by coverage efficiency
- `generateReimmersionGuide()`: produces `ReimmersionGuide` with steps, Kanji vectors, synthesis prompt
- `writeReimmersionProtocol()`: persists guide as JCross node

**Fictional review tasks** (cost: zero, forces model to read real files):
- "Verify ZONE_CAPS are consistent with RefCountLedger thresholds" → reads `engine.ts`
- "Confirm session_bootstrap returns project_wisdom first" → reads `server.ts`
- "Check MLX-Swift version constraint" → reads `Package.swift`
- etc.

### 🆕 Calibration CLI System

**New file** `src/cli/calibrate.ts`: Memory-aware cold-start calibration tool.

Three task generation strategies (all zero LLM cost):
- **Strategy A** (Memory-derived): from `decisions.jsonl`, L1 summaries, zone health metrics
- **Strategy B** (Git Diff reverse): parses `fix:`/`bug:` commits, extracts file paths automatically
- **Strategy C** (L1.5 sampling): daily-rotating JCross node pairs → dependency-exploration tasks

Output: compact calibration packet (~500–1,500 tokens) that brings any blank-slate LLM to project-expert state.

**Isolated storage**: all writes go to `~/.openclaw/calibration/` — **never touches** `front/near/mid/deep/`.

### 🆕 Setup Wizard

**New file** `src/cli/setup.ts`: Interactive first-time setup.

```bash
npm run setup
```

- Prompts for **custom command name** (e.g., `moto-cal`, `vera`, `cal`)
- Registers shell alias in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`
- Generates portable shell wrapper script
- Saves config to `~/.openclaw/calibration/config.json`
- Runs initial calibration on completion

### Modified Files

#### `src/memory/engine.ts` (full rewrite)
- Removed: old `runLruGc()` (kept as backward-compat alias)
- Added: `classifyNode()`, `RefCountLedger`, `runAutonomousGc()`, Tombstone system
- Added: import of `DecisionLedger`, `PatternExtractor`, `updateProjectWisdom` from `intelligence.ts`
- All three GC tracks integrated into single `runAutonomousGc()` call

#### `src/memory/auto-selector.ts`
- `compileTriLayerJCross()`: now calls `classifyNode()` before `engine.write()`
- Replaced `runLruGc()` → `runAutonomousGc()` with detailed log output
- Reports classifier / cold / LRU eviction counts separately

#### `src/mcp/server.ts`
- Added 5 new tool definitions and handlers
- `session_bootstrap` returns `project_wisdom` as first field
- Background GC loop now uses `runAutonomousGc()`
- `run_lru_gc` handler returns full `{ classifier, coldEvictions, lruEvictions }` report

#### `package.json`
- New scripts: `setup`, `calibrate`, `calibrate:sync`, `calibrate:json`
- New bin entries: `verantyx-setup`, `verantyx-calibrate`
